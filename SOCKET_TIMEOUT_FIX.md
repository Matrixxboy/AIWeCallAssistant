# Socket.IO Timeout Error Fix

## Issue Resolved: "Error: timeout"

### Problem
The Socket.IO client was attempting to connect to the signaling server in hosted environments, causing timeout errors after 5 seconds when the server wasn't reachable.

### Root Cause
- Socket.IO was trying to connect to `localhost:5001` or `${host}:5001` in hosted environments
- Hosted environments (like fly.dev) don't expose port 5001 or allow localhost connections
- The timeout error was still appearing in console even with error handling

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Environment Detection
```javascript
const isLocalDevelopment = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || 
                          window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1' ||
                          window.location.hostname === '0.0.0.0';
```

#### 2. Conditional Socket Connection
```javascript
if (!isLocalDevelopment) {
  // Immediately disable voice calling without attempting connection
  setIsSignalingAvailable(false);
  setErrorMessage('Voice calling is currently unavailable in this hosted environment.');
  return; // Exit early, no Socket.IO connection attempted
}

// Only connect in local development
const socketConnection = io('http://localhost:5001', { /* ... */ });
```

#### 3. Clean Error Prevention
- **Before Fix**: Socket.IO attempted connection → timeout after 5s → error in console
- **After Fix**: Environment detected → connection skipped → immediate graceful degradation

### Behavior Changes

#### ✅ Local Development (localhost)
- Full Socket.IO connection to signaling server
- Complete voice calling functionality
- WebRTC peer-to-peer audio calls

#### ✅ Hosted Environment (fly.dev, etc.)
- **No timeout errors** - connection never attempted
- Immediate feature detection and graceful degradation
- Clear user messaging about service unavailability
- Disabled call buttons with informative labels

### Code Changes Made

1. **Environment Detection**: Added hostname checking before Socket.IO initialization
2. **Early Return**: Skip connection attempt entirely in hosted environments
3. **Immediate State Update**: Set `isSignalingAvailable(false)` right away
4. **Clean Messaging**: User-friendly explanation of feature limitations

### Testing Results

#### ✅ Before Fix
```
Console: Socket connection error: Error: timeout
Result: Error visible to users, confusing experience
```

#### ✅ After Fix
```
Console: Voice calling disabled: Hosted environment detected
Result: Clean user experience, no errors
```

### Benefits

1. **No More Console Errors**: Clean developer console in hosted environments
2. **Better UX**: Immediate feedback instead of 5-second wait
3. **Resource Efficient**: No unnecessary connection attempts
4. **Clear Communication**: Users understand why feature is unavailable

### Deployment Implications

- **Local Development**: No changes, full functionality preserved
- **Hosted Without Signaling**: Clean degradation, no errors
- **Hosted With Signaling**: Can be easily enabled by updating environment detection

This fix ensures the voice calling feature fails gracefully in environments where the signaling server isn't available, providing a professional user experience without console errors.
